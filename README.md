# Loan App
Simple application for calculating loan payments and interest.
The user enters a loan amount, an interest rate, and a repayment length in years. The user will press a calculate button, and after a brief view of a progress graphic, the app will display the monthly payment, the total amount paid including interest, and the interest alone.

The app utilizes Bootstrap for styling purposes, but only vanilla Javascript for functionality. jQuery is used only because it is a dependency for Bootstrap.
